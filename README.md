# Game of Life

### **Explanation:**
- **Description**: This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. It simulates the evolution of cells on a grid based on simple rules: cells can either be alive or dead, and their state evolves over generations according to these rules.
  
- **How to run the project**: 
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/GameOfLife.git
     ```
  2. Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd GameOfLife
     ```
  3. Run the program:
     ```bash
     python GoL.py
     ```

- **How to contribute**:
  1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
  2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-name
     ```
  3. Make your changes and commit them:
     ```bash
     git commit -m 'Add a feature'
     ```
  4. Push your branch to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-name
     ```
  5. Create a pull request on the original repository to propose your changes.

**Animation Update**:
Description: The project now includes an updated grid display for continuous animation. The screen is cleared between generations to provide a smooth visualization of the cell evolution.

Changes Made:
- Added screen clearing functionality using ANSI escape sequences.
- Introduced a delay between generations for better visualization.
- Improved code readability and comments.

This update includes a new section describing the animation update and the changes made to the project.
